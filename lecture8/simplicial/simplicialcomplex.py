class SimplicialComplex(object):
    '''A finite abstract simplicial complex.
    
    A simplicial :term:`complex` is a generalisation of a network in which
    vertices (0-simplices) and edges (1-simplices) can be composed
    into triangles (2-simplices), tetrahedrons (3-simplices) and so
    forth. This class actually implements closed simplicial complexes
    that contain every simplex, every :term:`face` of that simplex, every face
    of those simplices, and so forth. Operations to add and remove
    simplices cascade to keep the complex closed: if a simplex is an
    element of a complex, then all its faces are also elements, and so
    on recursively.

    The class also includes some topological operations, notably for
    computing the :term:`Euler characteristic` of a complex and
    performing Euler integration, and for computational :term:`homology`.
