class Embedding(object):
    '''The abstract embedding of a simplicial complex into a space. An embedding
    associates a position with each 0-simplex in the complex, allowing spatial calculations
    to be performed.

    Embeddings serve two distinct purposes. Firstly, they admit spatial calculations
    as well as purely topological ones, which broadens the application areas to which
    we can apply simplicial ideas. Secondly, embeddings form the basis for visualisation,
    as they allow points (0-simplices) in a complex to be associated with points in
    an n-dimensional embedding space. This can result in more meaingful diagrams.

    An embedding can be specified in two distinct ways. Positions can be supplied
    explicitly for simplices by name. Alternatively, sub-clases can provide positioning
    functions that map simplices to positions using arbitrary code. The former is useful
    for complexes with irregular embeddings, while the latter is better-suited to
    regular embeddings. Explicit positions override computed positions, which allows
    small distortions to be applied easily to otherwise regular embeddings.

    It is also possible to override the distane metrioc to construct different ways
    of metricating a space. 

    Note that in most cases an embedding is based on simplex names, and so care needs to
    be taken when relabeling simplices in the underlying complex.
